# Norm (mathematics)

From [Norm (mathematics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)):
> In mathematics, a norm is a function from a real or complex vector space to the non-negative real numbers that behaves in certain ways like the distance from the origin.

Typically, for $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the norm of $x$ is defined as

$$
|| \boldsymbol{x} || = \left( x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
This definition of norm is called the _Euclidean norm_ or the _$L^2$ norm_


Similarly, for $\boldsymbol{z} = (z_1, z_2, \cdots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$, the norm of $\boldsymbol{z}$ is defined as
$$
|| \boldsymbol{z} || = \left( |z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_n|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
where $|z_i|$ is the absolute value of $z_i$.

There are also other definitions of norm. For example, the $L^p$ norm for $\boldsymbol{z}$ is defined as:

$$
|| \boldsymbol{z} ||_p = \left( |z_1|^p + \cdots + |z_n|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$
## Norm of complex number

In some fields or some applications, the norm of a complex number $z = a + ib$ is defined as $(a^2 + b^2)$ instead of $\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)}$ . See [Gauss' definition of norm for complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#cite_note-49) and [std::norm](https://cplusplus.com/reference/complex/norm/) in C++ standard library.
