# Field Regions

## Overview  
  
The fields surrounding an antenna are divided into 3 principle regions:  
  
1. Reactive Near Field  
1. Radiative Near Field (Fresnel Region)  
1. Far Field (Fraunhofer Region)  
  
The 3 fields are categorized roughly based on the relative rates at which the amplitude of parts of the electric and magnetic fields diminish as distance from the radiating element increases:  
  
* Reactive Near Field: amplitude falls off as $r^{-3}$  
* Radiative Near Field: amplitude falls off as $r^{-2}$  
* Far Field: amplitude falls off as $r^{-1}$  
  
The boundaries of the field regions are defined dependent on the length of the antenna, $D$, and the wavelength of the radio wave, $\lambda$.  
  
## Electromagnetically Short Antennas  
  
For antennas shorter than half of the wavelength of the radiation they emit ($D < \lambda / 2$), the boundaries is defined as follows:  
  
* $r < \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi}$: Reactive Near Field  
* $\frac{\lambda}{2 \pi} < r < \lambda$: Radiative Near Field  
* $\lambda < r < 2 \lambda$: "Transition zone"  
* $r > 2 \lambda$: Far Field  
  
Despite the definition of far-field distance above, the far-field generally starts at  
  
$$  
r > \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}  
$$  
  
## Electromagnetically Long Antennas  
  
For antennas physically larger than a half-wavelength of the radiation they emit  ($D > \lambda / 2$), the near and far fields are defined in terms of the Fraunhofer distance $d_F$:  
  
* $r < 0.62 \sqrt{\frac{D^3}{\lambda}}$: Reactive Near Field  
* $0.62 \sqrt{\frac{D^3}{\lambda}} < r < d_F$: Radiative Near Field  
* $r > d_F$: Far Field  
  
where  
  
$$  
d_F = \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}  
$$  
  
with additional constraints that  
  
$$  
d_F \gg D \\  
d_F \gg \lambda  
$$
