# Inter-channel Phase Difference 

Inter-channel phase difference (IPD) is a useful feature in the estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a sound source.

While the actual form of the IPD varies from implementation to implementation, it should always reflect the phase differences between the audio channels.

## Phase Difference between audio channels

Given 

* $X_m \left( f,t \right) \in \mathbb{C}$: The short-time fourier transform (STFT) of the audio signal of the $m$-th channel at frequency $f$ at time frame $t$
* $m_r$: The integer index of the reference audio channel

The phase difference between channel $m$ and $m_r$ is then

$$
\delta_{m} \left( f,t \right) = \angle X_m \left( f,t \right) - \angle X_{m_r} \left(f,t \right)
$$

## Possible forms of IPD

### Form 1

One may define IPD as 

$$
F_m \left(f,t \right) = \log \left( {X_{m_r}\left(f,t\right)} \over X_m\left(f,t\right) \right)
$$

such that the phase difference can be derived from 

$$
\delta_{m} \left( f,t \right) = - \mathfrak{I} \left( F_m \left(f,t\right) \right)
$$

where $\mathfrak{I}\left( \cdot \right)$ is the imaginary part operator

### Form 2

Another way to define IPD is 

$$
F_m \left(f,t \right) = X_m \left( f,t \right) \cdot X_{m_r}^* \left( f,t \right)
$$

such that the phase difference can be derived from 

$$
\delta_{m} \left( f,t \right) = \angle F_m \left(f,t \right)
$$
