# Windows Keyboard Input Not Detected

## Context

After removing several unused language input methods on a virtual desktop environment, the keyboard input suddenly stops working. Typing characters show nothing; the "Num Lock" and "Caps Lock" indicator lights do not toggle when the corresponding keys are pressed. It's as if the keyboard is not connected to the PC at all.

This problem only happens in the virtual desktop environment. When switching back to the local PC, the keyboard works as expected.

## Problem

How to resolve the problem?

## Solution

It's unclear what fixes the issue, but toggling some of the following options using mouse seems to bring the keyboard back:

* Setting -> Typing -> Multilingual text suggestions
* Setting -> Keyboard -> Use your device without a physical keyboard
