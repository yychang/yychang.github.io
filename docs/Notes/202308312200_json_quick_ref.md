# JSON Quick Reference

## Basics

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. There are 3 types of data in JSON:

1. JSON value
2. JSON object
3. JSON array

A _JSON value_ can be one of the following 6 types:

1. _Number_: double-precision floating-point value
2. _String_: double-quoted string
3. _Boolean_: true or false
4. _JSON object_
5. _JSON array_
6. null


A _JSON object_ is:

* An unordered set of name/value pairs, beginning with left curly brace (`{`) and ending with right curly brace (`}`). 
* The name/value pair consists of a name, followed by colon (`:`), followed by a value.
* The name has to be a _String_ (i.e., double-quoted string).
* The value has to be a _JSON value_.
* Each name/value pair is separated by a comma (`,`).

Example of JSON object:

```json
{
    "projectName": "MyProject",
    "Version": 1.0
}
```

!!! note
    The trailing comma (comma after the last name/value pair) is a syntax error per the [JSON spec](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

A _JSON array_ is:

* An ordered collection of _JSON values_, beginning with left square brace (`[`) and ending with right square brace (`]`).
* Each value is separated by a comma (`,`)

Example of JSON array:

```json
[ 
    1.0, 
    "2.0", 
    {
        "projectName": "MyProject"
    }
]
```
