# Software Log Levels

Per https://stackoverflow.com/a/2031209:

> - **Trace** - Only when I would be "tracing" the code and trying to find one **part** of a function specifically.
> - **Debug** - Information that is diagnostically helpful to people more than just developers (IT, sysadmins, etc.).
> - **Info** - Generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc). Info I want to always have available but usually don't care about under normal circumstances. This is my out-of-the-box config level.
> - **Warn** - Anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which I am automatically recovering. (Such as switching from a primary to backup server, retrying an operation, missing secondary data, etc.)
> - **Error** - Any error which is fatal to the **operation**, but not the service or application (can't open a required file, missing data, etc.). These errors will force user (administrator, or direct user) intervention. These are usually reserved (in my apps) for incorrect connection strings, missing services, etc.
> - **Fatal** - Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss (or further data loss). I reserve these only for the most heinous errors and situations where there is guaranteed to have been data corruption or loss.

Per [Microsoft Logging Loglevel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loglevel?view=net-8.0#fields):

|             |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trace       | 0   | Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment. |
| Debug       | 1   | Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value.                               |
| Information | 2   | Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value.                                                                                                         |
| Warning     | 3   | Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop.                                                           |
| Error       | 4   | Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure.                        |
| Critical    | 5   | Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention.                                                                        |
| None        | 6   | Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not write any messages.                                                                                                  |

Implementation examples:

* Trace
    * The logs about "entering function X", "exiting function X"
* Information
    * The telemetry events such as the timestamp where the data processing pipeline starts, and the number of data package processed by the pipeline when the pipeline shuts down.
* Warning
    * The unusual events that are bad but not bad enough to cause major issues. For example, "bad data in the package detected"
* Error 
    * The problematic events that are bad enough to hinder normal operation. For example, "Failed to initialize the pipeline"
