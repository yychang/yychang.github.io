# C++ Lambda Expression Quick Reference

## Syntax

Basic syntax:

> \[_captures_\] (_params_) { _body_ }

where

* _captures_: A comma-separated list of things that the _body_ can refer to.
    * Things that can be _captures_ include:
        * The _capture-default_, which can be one of the followings:
            * `&`: All variables used in the _body_ are "captured by reference"
            * `=`: All variables used in the _body_ are "captured by copy"
        * The `this` pointer
        * The individual variables
    * The _capture-default_, if used, must be the first entry in the list.
    * The _captures_ can be an empty list
* _params_: The parameter list of the lambda expression
* _body_: The function body

Some examples:

```cpp
// Create a lambda function that adds 2 to the input int value
auto f1 = [](int a1) { return a1 + 2; };
int f1_out = f1(10);    // return 12

// Create a lambda function that captures the local variable x by copy
int x = 5;
auto f2 = [x](int a1) { return a1 + x; };
x = 6;
int f2_out = f2(10);    // return 15 because x was 5 when f2 was created.

// Create a lambda function that captures the local variable x by reference
auto f3 = [&x](int a1) { return a1 + x; };
x = 7;
int f3_out = f3(10);    // return 17 because x was 7 when f3 was called.

```
