# Convolution
## Definition

### Basic 1D Form

For complex-valued function $f, g: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{C}$, the convolution of $f$ and $g$ is defined as

$$
(f*g)(t) \triangleq \int _{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\tau)g(t-\tau)\,d\tau = \int _{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t-\tau)g(\tau)\,d\tau
$$

For complex-valued discrete function $f[n]$ and $g[n]$, the discrete convolution of $f$ and $g$ is given by

$$
(f*g)[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}f[m]g[n-m] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}f[n-m]g[m]
$$

> YYC Note:
> Here I assume the [codomain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codomain) of $f$ and $g$ are 1-dimensional because I don't know how to compute $f(\tau)g(t-\tau)$ if their codomain is not 1-dimentional.

### General multi-dimensional Form

For complex-valued function $f, g: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{C}$, the convolution of $f$ and $g$ is defined as

$$
(f*g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}f(y)g(x-y)\,dy=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}f(x-y)g(y)\,dy
$$

$(f*g)(x)$ is well-defined only if $f$ and $g$ decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity in order for the integral to exist.

## Properties

### Algebraic properties

Commutativity

$$
f*g = g*f
$$

Associativity

$$
f*(g*h) = (f*g)*h
$$

Distributivity

$$
f*(g+h) = f*g + f*h
$$

Associativity with scalar multiplication

$$
a (f*g) = (af)*g, \quad \forall a \in \mathbb{C}
$$

Complex conjugation

$$
\overline{f*g}=\overline{f}*\overline{g}
$$
