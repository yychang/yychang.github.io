# Sound Pressure Level

## Definition  
  
The sound pressure level (SPL) is a logarithmic measure of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference value. It is defined as  
  
$$  
L_p = 20 \cdot log_{10} \left( \frac{p}{p_0} \right)  
$$  
  
where  
  
* $p$ is the root mean square sound pressure  
* $p_0$ is the reference sound pressure  
  
The commonly used reference sound pressure in air is  
  
$$  
p_0 = 20 \mu \text{Pa}  
$$  
  
which is often considered as the threshold of human hearing. (In other words, 20 ÂµPa corresponds to 0 dB SPL)  
  
Note that different values of $p_0$ may be used for different transmission media.  
  
## Weighted Sound Level  
  
When measuring the sound level for certain purposes, a weighting curve (in frequency) may be applied to emphasize or de-emphasize the sound energy in different frequency band. For example, when measuring the loudness of noise, the "A-weighting" curve may be applied to reflect the human ear response (high response around 1k-10kHz, low response elsewhere).  
  
### A-weighting Sound Level  
  
The A-weighting sound level is the sound level measured with the A-weighting curve. The measurement is denoted in the unit of "dB(A)" or "dBA"
