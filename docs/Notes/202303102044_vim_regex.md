# Vim Regular Expression

## Basics

## Greedy vs non-greedy

(under construction)

## Lookahead and lookbehind assertions

`abc\(def\)\@=`: Match `abc` if it is followed by `def` (lookahead assertion)

`abc\(def\)\@!`: Match `abc` if it is NOT followed by `def` (negative lookahead assertion)

`\(abc\)\@<=def`: Match `def` if it is preceded by `abc` (lookbehind assertion)

`\(abc\)\@<!def`: Match `def` if it is NOT preceded by `abc` (negative lookbehind assertion)

## Match start and end

`\zs`: The "match start." Everything before `\zs` is treated as lookbehind assertion.

`\ze`: The "match end." Everything after `\ze` is treated as lookahead assertion.

Example:

```vim
" This prints 'def'
let x = matchstr('abc def ghi', 'abc \zsdef\ze ghi')
echo x

" This prints empty string
let y = matchstr('def ghi', 'abc \zsdef\ze ghi')
echo y
```
