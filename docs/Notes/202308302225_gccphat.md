# Generalized Cross-Correlation Phase Transform

## Context

Given:

* $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}$: A signal source
* $y_1(t) = \alpha_1 \cdot x(t - t_1) + n_1(t) \in \mathbb{R}$: A sensor capturing the signal $x(t)$, with attenuation factor $0 < \alpha_1 \leq 1$, a time delay $t_1 \geq 0$, and a noise $n_1(t)$
* $y_2(t) = \alpha_2 \cdot x(t - t_2) + n_2(t) \in \mathbb{R}$: Another sensor capturing the signal $x(t)$, with attenuation factor $0 < \alpha_2 \leq 1$, a time delay $t_2 \geq 0$, and a noise $n_2(t)$

Assume that the noise signals $n_1(t)$ and $n_2(t)$ are uncorrelated with the source signal $x(t)$ and are uncorrelated with each other, we want to find the time difference $\ell$

$$
\ell = t_1 - t_2
$$

, which is the time difference of $x(t)$ arriving the two sensors.

One intuitive method is to compute the cross-correlation between $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$, and locate the peak:

$$
\begin{align}
R_{y_1, y_2}(\tau) &= E\left\{ y_1(t) y_2(t + \tau) \right\} \\
\hat{\ell} &= \underset{\tau}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\,{R(\tau)}
\end{align}
$$

But depending on the power spectral density of $x(t)$, the cross-correlation $R_{y_1,y_2}(\tau)$ may not show a sharp peak, reducing our confidence on the accuracy of $\hat{\ell}$.

## Problem

How to improve the shape of the cross-correlation so that it can show a sharper peak?

## Solution

Apply a weighting function to whiten the signal. This can be done by computing the followings:

$$
\begin{align}
S_{y_1,y_2}(f) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{R_{y_1,y_2}(\tau) e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} d \tau} \\
\tilde{R}_{y_1,y_2}(\tau) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{S_{y_1,y_2}(f)}{|S_{y_1,y_2}(f)|} e^{j 2 \pi f \tau} df \\
\tilde{\ell} &= \underset{\tau}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\,{\tilde{R}(\tau)}
\end{align}
$$

The method above is called _generalized cross-correlation phase transform_.
