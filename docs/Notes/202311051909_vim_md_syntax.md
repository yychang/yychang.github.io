# Vim Incorrectly Shows Italic After Bold Syntax

## Context

For a Markdown note like the following:

```
* A list entry with **bold text** and other stuff
```

User is supposed to see in Vim:

> \* A list entry with **\*\*bold text\*\*** and other stuff

However, in Vim 8.2 (with `markdown.vim` by [Tim Pope dated 20191205](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/blob/a273e6d1f366ed55b9e3effc6eb065a1e7decb68/syntax/markdown.vim)), what user would see is

> \* A list entry with **\*\*bold text**\*\* *and other stuff*

where

1. the closing pattern for bold (`**`) is not shown in bold format, and
2. the text after the bold syntax is shown as italic

## Problem

How to fix the incorrect italic syntax shown in Vim?

## Solution

Use a newer `markdown.vim` like [this one dated 20221013](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/blob/f2b82b7884a3d8bde0c5de7793b27e07030eb2bc/syntax/markdown.vim)

To use the custom `markdown.vim` without overwriting the one from the official Vim installation, do the following:

1. Create the folder `~/.vim/syntax/`
2. Copy the custom `markdown.vim` to `~/.vim/syntax/markdown.vim`
3. Reload the opened file, or restart Vim, to make the new syntax highlight file effective
