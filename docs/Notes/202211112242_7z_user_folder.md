# 7-zip Mistakenly Zipping The Entire UserProfile folder

## Context

When running `7-zip` to zip the `.git` folder with command like

```
7z.exe a -r Home C:\Users\MyAccount\.git
```

7z will attempt to scan some other folders under `C:\Users\MyAccount` such as `C:\Users\MyAccount\AppData`, which is unexpected and undesired.

## Problem

How to work around the issue and zip the `.git` folder?

## Solution

Run the following command instead:

```
7z.exe a -r Home C:\Users\MyAccount\.git\*
```
